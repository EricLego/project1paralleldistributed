# Project 1 â€“ Countdown Protocol

This repository contains a Java implementation of the countdown protocol described in Project 1, Phase 1. The system exposes both iterative and concurrent server suites that follow a three-tier design.

## Repository structure

```
src/main/java/com/example/countdown/
  service/               # Application-tier countdown business logic
  common/                # Infrastructure components shared by servers
  iterative/             # Iterative server and client implementations
  concurrent/            # Concurrent server and client implementations
docs/                    # Architecture report and sample output transcripts
```

## Building

```bash
javac $(find src/main/java -name "*.java")
```

The compiled `.class` files will be placed alongside their source files.

## Running

### Iterative server and client

Open two terminals:

1. Start the server (default port 5000):
   ```bash
   java -cp src/main/java com.example.countdown.iterative.IterativeCountdownServer
   ```
2. Run the client with a positive integer argument:
   ```bash
   java -cp src/main/java com.example.countdown.iterative.IterativeCountdownClient 5
   ```

### Concurrent server and client

Open two terminals:

1. Start the server (default port 5001):
   ```bash
   java -cp src/main/java com.example.countdown.concurrent.ConcurrentCountdownServer
   ```
2. Run the client:
   ```bash
   java -cp src/main/java com.example.countdown.concurrent.ConcurrentCountdownClient 4
   ```

Both clients print the countdown returned by the server. Supply `host` and `port` arguments to override defaults.

## Testing

Sample command transcripts are stored in [`docs/sample-output.md`](docs/sample-output.md) and were generated by running the commands above.

## Deliverables

* Source code for iterative and concurrent suites (see `src/main/java`).
* [`docs/three-tier-architecture.md`](docs/three-tier-architecture.md) summarises the layered design.
* [`docs/sample-output.md`](docs/sample-output.md) contains terminal transcripts demonstrating the countdown protocol.
