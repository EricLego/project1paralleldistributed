# Project 1 â€“ Countdown Protocol (Python)

This repository now provides a Python implementation of the countdown protocol described in Project 1, Phase 1. The system exposes iterative and concurrent TCP server suites that follow a three-tier design.

## Repository structure

```
src/main/python/countdown/
  service.py             # Application-tier countdown business logic
  common/                # Infrastructure components shared by servers
  iterative/             # Iterative server and client implementations
  concurrent/            # Concurrent server and client implementations
docs/                    # Architecture report and sample output transcripts
```

## Running

All commands assume you are in the repository root, have Python 3.11+, and set `PYTHONPATH=src/main/python` so the modules can be imported.

### Iterative server and client

Open two terminals.

1. Start the server (default host `0.0.0.0`, port `5000`):
   ```bash
   PYTHONPATH=src/main/python python -m countdown.iterative.server 5000 0.0.0.0
   ```
2. Run the client with a positive integer argument:
   ```bash
   PYTHONPATH=src/main/python python -m countdown.iterative.client 5 localhost 5000
   ```

Use `--max-clients` on the server to exit automatically after serving a fixed number of requests.

### Concurrent server and client

1. Start the server (default host `0.0.0.0`, port `5001`):
   ```bash
   PYTHONPATH=src/main/python python -m countdown.concurrent.server 5001 0.0.0.0 --max-workers 4
   ```
2. Run the client:
   ```bash
   PYTHONPATH=src/main/python python -m countdown.concurrent.client 4 localhost 5001
   ```

Override host/port as needed. The concurrent server spawns a thread for each client connection (bounded by `--max-workers` when provided).

## Testing

Sample command transcripts are stored in [`docs/sample-output.md`](docs/sample-output.md) and were generated by running the commands above.

## Deliverables

* Source code for iterative and concurrent suites (see `src/main/python/countdown`).
* [`docs/three-tier-architecture.md`](docs/three-tier-architecture.md) summarises the layered design.
* [`docs/sample-output.md`](docs/sample-output.md) contains terminal transcripts demonstrating the countdown protocol.
